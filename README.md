# ImperialAssaultSkirmishBuilder
This is my first attempt at an Android app to build skirmish teams for the Fantasy Flight game, Imperial Assault.

## Initial Goals
- The ability to browse a gallery of currently published cards (units only, command cards will be a future project)
- The ability to select these cards to add to a personal list/deck for Skirmish. There will be inspiration taken from other deckbuilder apps for other card games.
